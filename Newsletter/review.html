  <h3>Ukraine war: Kyiv uses longer-range US missiles for first time</h3>
  <p>Ukraine has begun using longer-range ballistic missiles against Russia that were secretly provided by the US, American officials have confirmed.
    The weapons were sent as part of a previous US support package, and arrived this month. Officials said they were not announced publicly to maintain Ukraine's "operational security".
    They have already been used at least once to strike Russian targets in occupied Crimea.
    Further US aid is now heading to Kyiv.
    More American weaponry is expected to be sent imminently, after President Joe Biden signed off on Wednesday a new package of economic and military support for Ukraine worth $61bn (£49bn).</p></div>

        <h3>Renu Bhatnagar</h3>
        <p>Renu Bhatnagar, born in New Delhi, managed to buy two houses, a Bentley, a Ferrari and visit 16 countries in just one year. Previously, she worked for minimum wage in one of the Indian banks. So how did she manage to earn so much money in one year? She tells us her story.
            "For four years, I worked as a customer consultant at a bank branch. I completed my studies in banking and finance with distinction and thought that working at a bank would be the realization of my dreams. I hoped to earn a lot of money and have the opportunity to make a career, but I had to start with the lowest salary at the bank. Unfortunately, for 4 years, I did not receive a single raise or promotion opportunity, in addition to having more and more responsibilities. I was almost falling into depression because I did not know what to do and did not want to change jobs to start all over again without guarantee that it would be better."
            Renu needed to work a lot because she had a loan for a small one-bedroom apartment, which took more than half of her salary. She lived alone, so she couldn't count on anyone's help. In addition, rising inflation made it increasingly difficult for her to make ends meet at the end of the month. The loan and store prices were rising, unlike Renu's salary.
            "On a rainy day, a regular customer walked into the branch. He was smiling from the entrance, which really surprised me because he had been depressed lately. He sat next to me and told me he wanted to pay off all his loans and open an account that operated overseas, because he was going to take a long vacation."</p></div>

                   <h3>Ancient Greece</h3>
                    <p>As archaeologists, and particularly as geoarchaeologists (i.e., scientists using earth sciences tools to address archaeological questions), we could not be more excited about the unprecedented level of insight that sedaDNA can provide, especially given that sediments are ubiquitous, whereas hominin fossils are extremely rare. However, to properly interpret sedaDNA, we need to understand its context and association within the archaeological record.
                        Obtaining information about ancient humans, vegetation, or animal communities requires the excavation and retrieval of buried material. During excavation, we create associations between materials by observing changes in their sedimentary context and defining individual layers. We can then date the sediments or individual components and assign the same age to materials enclosed in the same layer. Much depends on this association, and no debate is more heated in the field than the question of context: Does an artifact or fossil belong to a certain layer or not? A related question is how a particular layer formed: Does it result from a quick episode of deposition preserving everything in situ, or are the sediments disturbed or even redeposited, mixing materials of variable ages?</p></div>
